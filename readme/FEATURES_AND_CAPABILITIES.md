### Moodle Web Services
**Core Functions:**
- `core_course_create_courses` - Create courses with metadata
- `core_course_get_courses` - List and retrieve course information
- `core_course_get_categories` - Manage course categories
- `core_course_get_contents` - Get detailed course structure

**WSManageSections Plugin:**
- `local_wsmanagesections_create_sections` - Dynamic section creation
- `local_wsmanagesections_get_sections` - Detailed section information
- `local_wsmanagesections_update_sections` - Section modifications
- `local_wsmanagesections_move_section` - Section repositioning

### Content Processing Pipeline
1. **Parse** chat content for educational material
2. **Analyze** topics, code examples, and structure
3. **Organize** content into logical sections
4. **Create** course with appropriate metadata
5. **Build** section structure dynamically
6. **Format** content for Moodle display
7. **Log** planned activities for manual creation

## 📊 What Works vs. What Requires Manual Setup

### ✅ Fully Automated
